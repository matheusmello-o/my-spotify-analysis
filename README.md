# My Spotify Analysis
Bringing together my love for data and music, this project will try to understand my own pattern of how I listen to music.

For the first step to this project, I'll have two targets:

- To do a exploration analysis to understand how I listen to music applying analysis techniques
- Make a prediction of how many minutes of music I'll listen in the end of 2023
